# Review: March 2021 / d2f189c

## General

* ~~Docker Compose file: Remove the port mappings for the
  ~~`launcher-backend` and `launcher-frontend` services. These allow you
  ~~to connect to the backend and frontend directly, from outside Docker
  ~~Compose, but you never need to do this; that is nginx's job, which is
  ~~correctly mapping port 443.

* nginx Configuration: It's a bit weird to listen on port 443 when
  you're not using TLS. I presume this is for the Swarm's benefit, but
  that _shouldn't_ impose on your set up.

* Your code is almost completely bereft of comments. Comments should be
  used liberally to describe what you're doing and, when it's
  non-obvious, why you have done it in a certain way. In general, code
  should be written for the benefit of human readers as a priority.

* My understanding is that the backend can currently only deal with
  bringing up one cluster at once (this explains some of the questions I
  pose below). I appreciate this is probably for the sake of having
  something sooner, rather than later. However, there's a lot of
  hardcoding that will make it harder to expand into a proper multi-user
  system when the time comes. I would advise starting to unpick this as
  soon as possible.

## Backend

* ~~`Dockerfile` and start up script: `startup.sh` should have the `+x`
  ~~permission, then it can run directly as your `CMD`. Note also that, in
  ~~your start up script, you source the OpenStack rcfile; this is not in
  ~~the repo (for good reason), but it should probably be referenced as a
  ~~secret in your Docker Compose file.

* ~~`app.py:7`: You should keep imports from the standard library together
  ~~and separated from imports of your own modules.

* ~~`routes.py:6-8`: The HTTP method you use for your routes should
  ~~reflect what the endpoints do. For example, `POST` is correct for
  ~~creating a new cluster, but not for fetching its status or destroying
  ~~one (`GET` and `DELETE`, respectively). The metaphor for a REST API is
  ~~that you apply an action (i.e., the HTTP method) to a resource (i.e.,
  ~~that specified by the URL). The metaphor you have used is to specify
  ~~resources as remote procedure calls. Something like the following
  ~~would follow the REST metaphor more closely:

  | Method   | Resource (URL) | Behaviour                         |
  | :------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------- |
  | `GET`    | `/clusters`    | List all current clusters&ast;    |
  | `POST`   | `/clusters`    | Create a new cluster              |
  | `GET`    | `/clusters/ID` | Get the status of cluster by `ID` |
  | `DELETE` | `/clusters/ID` | Destroy the cluster with `ID`     |

  ~~(&ast;) You don't currently have this route, neither is it necessary,
  ~~but I put it in this table to make it clearer how the metaphor works.

* ~~`hail_launcher.py:1-2`: You can do:

  ~~```python
  ~~from network import create, destroy
  ~~```

  ~~Given "create" and "destroy" are such generic terms, there's an
  ~~argument for just `import network`, which then namespaces these into
  ~~`network.create` and `network.destroy`, respectively. It's more to
  ~~type, but that's a small price to pay for the clarity you gain.

* ~~`hail_launcher.py`: Similarly to `app.py`, you should keep standard
  ~~library imports, external library imports and your own module imports
  ~~together in their own blocks. This makes it much clearer where
  ~~functionality is coming from. For example:

  ```python
  import json
  from os import path

  import openstack
  from aiohttp import web

  from network import create, destroy
  ```

* ~~`hail_launcher.py:6,10`: You have imported `os.path` twice, under two
  ~~different namespaces. Pick one and stick with it.

* `hail_launcher.py:14`: I presume this hardcoded constant is for
  debugging?

* `hail_launcher.py:18`: You are expecting a JSON request, but there's
  no clear indication of what that request should look like (e.g., in
  comments or documentation).

* `hail_launcher.py:40`: If an error has occurred, this needs to be
  returned back in the response as per the "contract" defined by the
  HTTP standard. `aiohttp` makes this easy with HTTP errors defined as
  exceptions:

  https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_quickstart.html#exceptions

* `hail_launcher.py:42`: You have an application-global status flag, set
  when you bring a cluster up. Why? Surely the up-ness of a cluster is
  dependent on the specific cluster.

* `hail_launcher.py:45`: `cluster-creation.sh` would be a better name
  for the script you invoke.

* `hail_launcher.py:51`: The messages you print out to the console at
  various points would be more useful in the response than just
  "Received".

* `hail_launcher.py:55`: You are expecting a JSON request, but there's
  no clear indication of what that request should look like (e.g., in
  comments or documentation).

* `hail_launcher.py:74`: This would be a good candidate for a 404 error,
  for example.

* `hail_launcher.py:79-126`: There's a lot of duplication in this
  function. It's quite hard to follow what status message corresponds
  with what state, as a result. For example, for the pending status on
  L123-126, what is the purpose of the `pending` key? etc.

* `hail_launcher.py:132`: This function is called from an asynchronous
  function, but it blocks. That will tie up the upstream handler and all
  other asynchronous processes that are currently running.

* `hail_launcher.py:148`: Is this `sleep` still necessary?

* `hail_launcher.py:158-159`: List comprehensions are a common idiom in
  Python. Your code could be written as:

  ```python
  network_list = [network.name for network in conn.network.networks()]
  ```

* `hail_launcher.py:166-174`: Similarly here:

  ```python
  ListOfFlavors = [str(flavor.name) for flavor in flavors if flavor.id is not None]
  ```

* `user-creation.sh:13`: Because `osdataproc` is part of your
  `requirements.txt`, you don't need to bother `pip install`'ing it to
  get its dependencies (as you already have them).

* `network.py:8`: This is the same hardcoded constant from
  `hail_launcher.py`. If you need to use the `username`, it's better to
  pass it around as a function argument, rather than defining constants
  in multiple places (these inevitably diverge).

* `network.py:28`: SQLite has the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` syntax,
  to avoid you having to check for an `OperationalError` exception,
  which may be raised for some other reason.

* `network.py:46`: This function is mostly from my example code to
  create a network. Note, however, that this code is non-defensive. What
  happens in your code if one of the OpenStack steps fails?

* `network.py:86`: You are assuming this is a new network (and thus
  doesn't have a database record) by virtue of the upstream calling code
  first checking that it doesn't exist. I only know that because I've
  read all the code, but it should be immediately obvious in this
  function either with a comment, or by moving the check into this
  function.

* `network.py:107-109`: A common Python idiom is destructuring. For
  example:

  ```python
  _, network_id, subnet_id, router_id, *_ = search
  ```

  Here we aren't interested in `search[0]`, hence the initial
  underscore, and we don't know what (if anything) comes after
  `search[3]`, so we hedge against that by using `*_`. To make this even
  clearer, you could change the SQL query to _only_ return the three
  fields you are actually interested in:

  ```python
  cursor.execute("""
    select network_id, subnet_id, router_id
    from   networking
    where  user_name = ?
  """, (username,))

  network_id, subnet_id, router_id = cursor.fetchone()
  ```

  (Note the above is only an illustration. It doesn't, for example,
  handle the situation where the query returns nothing.)

* `tenants.py`: As far as I can see, this is not used. I assume it's for
  future development, but without comments, I'm not sure of its purpose.

## Frontend

* `vue.config.js:5-6` and `webpack.config.js:3-4`: These separate
  configurations are at odds with each other. It would be worth reading
  the Vue and Webpack documentation to determine how these should both
  be set, if indeed they both need to be.

* `webpack.config.js:7-12`: This is just a literal object expression; it
  won't do anything (presuming this is parsed as JavaScript). Should it
  be part of the `module.exports`?

* `src/main.js:3`: You are importing a CSS file that doesn't exist in
  the repo.

* `src/App.vue:3-60`: Your "App" component delineates the different
  states that can be shown, predicated on `this.status` and
  `this.pending`. You could modularise these states into their own
  subcomponents, to make this component easier to follow.

* `src/App.vue:80`: What is this for?

* `src/App.vue:95-124`: It's quite cumbersome to see what's going on
  here (i.e., how you're mapping the API response to state). I believe
  this is the same logic:

  ```js
  switch (response.data.status) {
    case "down":
      this.status  = false;
      this.pending = false;
      break;

    case "pending":
      this.status  = response.data.pending == "DOWN";
      this.pending = true;
      break;

    case "up":
      this.status  = true;
      this.pending = false;
      this.ip      = response.data.cluster_ip;
      break;

    default:
      console.log("Returned unexpected status from server");
  }
  ```

  Note that this code assumes only one cluster can ever be created. For
  a "cluster-per-user" model, the easiest option would be to expand the
  backend API (as described above) and change this handler function to
  query the correct endpoint (e.g., `GET /clusters/ID`).

* `src/components/HelloWorld.vue`: You should remove this.

* `src/components/CreateButton.vue:25`: This is syntactically fine, but
  the whitespace you've used makes it stand out as "weird" (i.e., it
  draws the eye and forces you to think about what you're doing here, or
  whether it's a typo, etc.). Conventionally, it would be written:

  ```js
  newStatus = !newStatus;
  ```

  The same code exists in `src/components/DestroyButton.vue:25`.

* Speaking of which: `src/components/CreateButton.vue` and
  `src/components/DestroyButton.vue` are very similar; the only real
  difference is to which API endpoint the request gets sent. Could you
  create a more general button component and use this as a base for the
  creation and deletion buttons, to save duplicating code?
